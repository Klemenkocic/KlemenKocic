      "I was born in Ljubljana on 21.01.2000 at 21:00 and grew up in Domžale. My childhood was all movement—soccer, aikido, rugby, basketball, jiu-jitsu, and weightlifting. Those years taught me discipline, teamwork, and how to enjoy the grind. I studied at Gimnazija Poljane, where curiosity started to take a more deliberate shape.",
